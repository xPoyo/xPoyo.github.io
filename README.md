### Project: Machine Learning Solution for Visa Application Pre-screening
[Publication](https://github.com/xPoyo/xPoyo.github.io/blob/main/Proyect%20portfolio/Easy%20Visa.html)

The business communities in the United States constantly face a high demand for human resources. A key challenge is identifying and attracting the right talent, crucial for maintaining competitiveness. The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows foreign workers to work in the U.S. temporarily or permanently, ensuring that the employment of foreign workers does not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) administers immigration programs, processing labor certification applications from employers who want to bring foreign workers to the U.S.

In the fiscal year 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 applications from employers for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications, a 9% increase from the previous year. As the number of applicants grows each year, the case review process becomes increasingly tedious. To manage this growing applicant volume, OFLC hired EasyVisa, a data solution firm. As a Data Scientist at EasyVisa, I was tasked to analyze the provided data and, with the help of a classification model:

* Streamline the visa approval process.

### Project: Predictive Maintenance Modeling for Wind Turbine Generators
[Publication](https://github.com/xPoyo/xPoyo.github.io/blob/main/Proyect%20portfolio/ReneWind.html)

As renewable energy sources become increasingly vital in the global energy mix, wind energy stands out as one of the most developed renewable technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy emphasizes operational efficiency through predictive maintenance practices. Predictive maintenance, leveraging sensor data and analytical methods, aims to predict component degradation and future capacity, reducing operational and maintenance costs by preempting failures.

"ReneWind," a company specializing in enhancing machinery/processes in wind energy production using machine learning, has collected data on wind turbine generator failures using sensors. They provided an encrypted version of this sensitive sensor data, comprising 40 predictors with 20,000 observations in the training set and 5,000 in the test set. The goal is to build and fine-tune various classification models to identify failures, allowing for repairs before breakdowns occur, thereby reducing total maintenance costs. The model’s predictions will be interpreted as:

* True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted failures, leading to repair costs.
* False Negatives (FN): Real failures not detected by the model, leading to replacement costs.
* False Positives (FP): Detections where there is no failure, incurring inspection costs.
  
Repair costs are significantly lower than replacement costs, and inspection costs are lower than repair costs. A “1” in the target variables indicates a “failure,” while a “0” represents “No failure.”

Data Description:
The provided data is a transformed version of the original sensor-collected data.

Train.csv: Used to train and tune the models.
Test.csv: Used solely to assess the performance of the final chosen model.
Both datasets consist of 40 predictor variables and 1 target variable.

Approach:

* Data Analysis: Conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and the relationships between variables.
* Model Development: Built multiple classification models, fine-tuning them to identify the most effective in predicting turbine failures.
* Evaluation: Assessed the models based on their ability to minimize false negatives and false positives, thereby optimizing maintenance costs.
