## Projects
### Project: Data Analysis for a Food Aggregator Company
[Publication](https://xPoyo.github.io/Proyect-portfolio/Foodhub.html)

In this project, I undertook an exciting challenge as a Data Scientist contracted by a leading food aggregation company. The objective was to analyze a comprehensive dataset of orders placed by customers through their online portal. The aim was to gain a detailed understanding of the demand for various restaurants partnered with the platform. This analysis was crucial for enhancing customer experience and ultimately driving business growth.

- Approach:

Data Collection and Cleaning: We began by ensuring the quality of collected data, implementing cleaning and normalization processes to ensure accuracy in analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted thorough analysis to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the order data.

Data Visualization: I utilized tools like Python (with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn) to create intuitive visualizations that summarize key findings.
